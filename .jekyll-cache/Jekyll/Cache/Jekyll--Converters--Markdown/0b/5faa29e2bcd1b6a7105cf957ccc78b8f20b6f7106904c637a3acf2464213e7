<p>That’s how we would describe working with docster.</p>

<p>We first created it, when we needed an index file for a theme
documentation. jekyll offered collections which made the organization
into smaller chunks of documentation optimal. Especially because the
collections did not generate outputs for themselves.</p>

<p>This theme was created to generate an organized output. It does not
require any plugins, which means you can host on GitHub without much
effort.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Nice syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>dynamic multi-level navigation</li>
  <li>Sass stylesheets</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>We don’t believe in delivering Code without explanation. Especially not
for a documentation theme. So the
<a href="http://digitalmind.ch/themes/docster-jekyll-theme/demo/">Demo</a> doubles
as the documentation for Docster, that should help you set up your own
docs without any problems.</p>

<h3 id="feedback-wishes-problems">Feedback, Wishes, Problems</h3>

<p>If you run into any trouble or have a request please do so by opening
up an issue on the theme’s GitHub page.
If you just want to give us a general feedback feel free to <a href="http://digitalmind.ch/contact/">contact us!</a></p>
