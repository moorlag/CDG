<h3 id="developing-locally">Developing Locally</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked hard to make develoment easy. Running <code>script/bootstrap</code>
will get your gems setup (Jekyll, Sass, Compass, Foreman), then you can
get started running <code>script/server</code> which will run <code>jekyll serve &amp;&amp;
compass --watch</code> commands via terminal. Open http://localhost:4000 and
make changes to any of the, md, .html or .scss files and compass will
compile them for you.</p>

<p>Simply refresh your browser (or use something like livereload) and
develop away. Most of the colors and sizing is found in the
_variables.scss file.</p>
