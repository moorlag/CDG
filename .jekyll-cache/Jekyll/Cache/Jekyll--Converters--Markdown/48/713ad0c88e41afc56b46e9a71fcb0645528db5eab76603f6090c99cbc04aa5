I""<p><a href="http://chibicode.github.io/solo">Solo</a> is a Jekyll theme that supports
<strong>single-page websites</strong> only, but supports them well. Yes, it’s
responsive.</p>

<p>Solo is useful if…</p>

<ul>
  <li>You want to create an “about me” page from a single markdown file and
host it under a custom domain name.</li>
  <li>You want to create a single-page website that’s mostly text, like
<a href="https://knowyourcompany.com/">Know Your Company</a>.</li>
  <li>You want to share a single markdown file and tried GitHub Gist
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/dypsilon/5819504">example</a>), but would like
something nicer-looking.</li>
  <li>You want something like GitHub’s <a href="http://pages.github.com/">automatic page
generator</a> for a non-code repository.</li>
</ul>
