I"y<p>This is built on <a href="http://semantic.gs/">Semantic.gs</a> grid framework
which I edited a bit to make it fluid. It was forked from the wonderful
<a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes theme</a>
by Michael Rose.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy using, forking, whatevering this theme as much as I
did making it.</p>
