I"´<p>Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content
rather than aesthetic fluff. Pixyll is mobile <em>first</em>, fluidly
responsive, and delightfully lightweight.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to
make a statement, on all devices.</p>
