I"Ê<p>itâ€™s a full featured wiki powered by git, jekyll (github pages) and pull-requests!</p>

<p>It means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improvements in the cooperative aspect: forks, pull-requests and roles.</li>
  <li>You can customize your wiki as you want with style sheets and even changing the layout.</li>
  <li>No databases! Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.</li>
  <li>Markdown and html mixed together!</li>
  <li>History, revision comparison and everything you need from a wiki platform.</li>
  <li>You can edit your pages with the standard git editor, prose.io (integrated) or any kind of editor you prefer.</li>
  <li>You can fork/copy the master branch now and start your wiki in just 1 minute.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then share your wiki with us! please.</p>

<p>Note: You can even include the github wiki as a submodule and enable the conf, but itâ€™s an experimental feature and it implies less advantages and greater disadvantages for now.</p>
