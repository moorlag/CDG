<p>This is a modified version of <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/svm-ngvb/">Steve Millerâ€™s NGVM theme</a>.
I prefer large seriff fonts with minimal coloring and styling. Apart
form the typography, color scheme and layout, this theme has two useful
changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It allows you to maintain your website as a subdirectory on your
university of company domain (e.g.
http://university.edu/department/people/your-website). Most Jekyll
blogs are designed to be hosted at custom domain names.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most jekyll themes are blog-centric, or single page websites. This
theme lets you create multi-page website with a blog if you want.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both the above are not seminal achievements in science, but they are
useful. This theme also supports site analytics including
<a href="http://statcounter.com">Statcounter</a> and major comment providers for
blogs.</p>
