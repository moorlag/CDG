<p>If we had to choose one word to describe Gridster that would be it.
Gridster is a theme that focusses on multimedia. It contains different
post types to create video posts, audio posts, image post or gallery
posts with ease. We created a ton of Variables, that make customization
super easy.</p>

<p>This theme is powerful and it comes with a few extras. It also comes
with a lot of different layouts for you and in pretty material design.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The theme comes with a grunt file, which means that working with it is
super easy. We have Tasks that compile, concatenate, minify and even
deploy to your site.</p>

<h3 id="extensive-documentation">Extensive Documentation</h3>

<p>We donâ€™t believe in delivering Code without explanation. So we wrote an
extensive Documentation for Twister that goes over every single step
from installing all of the dependencies to explaining how to customize,
create posts and publish. We even tell you how you can host Twister
with Plugins on GitHub pages.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="http://gridster.digitalmind.ch/documentation/">Docs</a> out.</p>

<h3 id="feedback-wishes-problems">Feedback, Wishes, Problems</h3>

up an issue on the themeâ€™s GitHub page.</p>
