I"”<p>ET-Jekyll theme is based off of Dave Liepmannâ€™s awesome Tufte CSS - which takes itâ€™s style and inspiration from the wonderful book and handout designs of Edward Tufte.</p>

<p>The differences are subtle when comparing my variation to Tufte CSS, but these changes were made out of personal preference and are not in any way â€œbetterâ€. If you prefer the original CSS styling - please use it!</p>
