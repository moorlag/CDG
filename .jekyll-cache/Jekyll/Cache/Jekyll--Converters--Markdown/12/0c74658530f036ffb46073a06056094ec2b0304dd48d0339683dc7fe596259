<p>The Tufte-Jekyll theme is a natural extension of the work done by Dave
Leipmann on Github after he created a CSS file that allows web writers
to use the simple and elegant style employed by Edward Tufte in his
published materials. Tufteâ€™s style is known for its extensive use of
sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set
typography. The idea for this project is essentially cribbed wholesale
from Tufte and R Markdownâ€™s Tufte Handout format.</p>

<p>The Jekyll theme adds custom Liquid tags which combine with
Github-flavored Markdown and allow an author to write elegant technical
work without the need for a lot of hairy HTML.</p>

<p>Fork the repo and put your mad Ruby skillz to work. Some of the liquid
tags could be sexed up considerably. For instance, the sidenote tag
amped-up with the ability to auto-create numbering would be a huge
boon.</p>
