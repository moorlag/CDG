<p>Elementary is a zero Javascript and minimal CSS ultra lightweight Jekyll theme for those of you who love simplicity, yet don’t want to compromise on mobile responsiveness, readability and asthetics. Elementary is mobile first, content first and is aimed towards content heavy blogs.</p>

<p>The theme is highly customizable, takes less than 100 miliseconds to load, weighs less than 10K gzip’d and looks great on mobile. As vanilla as a website can get, this theme reminds the visitor of the pre 2000s era Internet, yet is backed by the modern CSS flexbox layout and has a sticky footer made with the same.</p>
