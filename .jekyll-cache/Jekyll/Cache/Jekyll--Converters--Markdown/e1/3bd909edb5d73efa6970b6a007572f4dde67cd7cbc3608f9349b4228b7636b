I"Â<p>A simple and clean Jekyll theme thatâ€™s easy to modify and very modular
in component and element reuse. The theme works well on mobile devices
as well, using bootstrap for much of the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>This theme uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics
support (both are disabled out of the box).</p>

<p>Check out the demo - thatâ€™s the live github branch and exactly what
youâ€™ll get when you clone it.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
