I"<<p>There is no clever design philosophy to talk about, I tried to find
something to work with, and ‘scribble’ came to my mind. This theme uses
Open Sans powered by Google Web Fonts, and was written in plain HTML,
SCSS &amp; CoffeeScript, though .scss &amp; .coffee files wouldn’t be included
in the theme.</p>
